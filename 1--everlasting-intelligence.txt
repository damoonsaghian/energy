maybe in the future there would be some way to extend human lifetime
maybe strong artificial intelligence and mind uploading will be possible, in the far far future

but personally i think our natural lifetime is more or less enough for experiencing life as an individual
actually we are not our memory, so why bother to make our personal memories and feelings, immortal
considering the horrible things that some mortals have done in human history, maybe mortality of human beings is a good thing
important thoughts can always be recorded, and every generation can study it and improve it, we lose our body and little memories but our more important thoughts can live for a long time, as a collective entity called human knowledge
