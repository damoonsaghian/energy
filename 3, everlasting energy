it seems that there is only one source of energy which is inexhaustible,
  the nucleus of abundant elements;

= Sun
we live because of the Sun, and because we are far enough from it;
but this also means that the energy is dispersed on earth
  and to harness it we need a lot of space;
solar power tower is a good method to do it;
".data/solar tower.png"

additionally we can use natural cyclic systems powered by sun:
, water cycle, which its use is almost saturated;
, high altitude wind, like Magenn air rotor system;

= energy storage
we can store energy in the electron arrangement of special materials;
they are called batteries or fuels,
  if the released energy is electricity or heat, respectively;

flow battery, regenerative fuel cell;
super_capacitor;

fossil fuels are how nature does this; they have very good energy densities, but
  burning them pollutes air, and their natural resources will eventually expire;
biofuel is a ridiculous, and at the same time a sad, lie;
  it leads to more hunger, and it is the most inefficient way to harness the energy of the sun;

= nuclear energy
imitating what happens in the sun,
  ie ramming two (mutually repelling) nuclei together (a process called fusion),
  is extremely hard to confine in systems smaller than stars;

currently the most common way to harness nuclear energy is by
  splitting a heavy nucleus apart (a process called fission),
  which in addition to not being an abundant energy source,
  is in general a very dirty process, producing a lot of highly radioactive wastes;
though maybe new generation reactors can solve these problems (partially at least);

anyway, it would be great if we could harness nuclear energy directly and safely,
  because energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego);
