i think energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego);
it seems that there is only one source of energy which is inexhaustible,
  the nucleus of abundant elements;

= Sun
we live because of the Sun, and because we are far enough from it;
but this also means that the energy is dispersed on earth
  and to harness it we need a lot of space;
solar power tower is a good method to do it;

additionally we can use natural cyclic systems powered by the Sun:
, water cycle, which its use is almost saturated;
, high altitude wind, like Magenn air rotor system;

= energy storage
we can store energy in the electron arrangement of special materials;
they are called batteries or fuels, if the released energy is electricity or heat, respectively;

flow battery, regenerative fuel cell;
with the help of super'capacitors we can reduce charge time, and implement regenerative braking;

fossil fuels are how nature does this; they have very good energy densities, but
  burning them pollutes air, and their natural resources will eventually expire;
biofuel is a ridiculous, and at the same time a sad, lie;
  it leads to more hunger, and it is the most inefficient way to harness the energy of the Sun;

= nuclear energy
everlasting intelligence requires everlasting energy;
so we need to harness nuclear energy directly;

currently the most common way to harness nuclear energy is by
  splitting a heavy nucleus apart (a process called fission),
  which in addition to not being an abundant energy source,
  is in general a very dirty process, producing high'level nuclear waste;
though maybe new generation reactors can solve these problems (partially at least);
