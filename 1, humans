artificial intelligence eliminates a lot of complexities required for sustaining biological intelligence
but at least for centuries to come, the existence of intelligence on earth will depend on survival of humankind

our basic biological needs are:
, air (oxygen plus nitrogen and/or helium to adjust its density, with suitable temperature and pressure)
, clean water (H2O plus some minerals to adjust the pH)
, nutrients

	"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huel"

naturally the environment we evolved in, supplies our basic needs
but in general, it's unstable, slow and insufficient (considering the current population and standards of life)
thus we have to find methods to do it faster and in larger amounts, without damaging our environment

in a prosperous society:
, no one's health is threatened by the lack of
	clean water, healthy food, shelter, sanitation, or medical services
, proper education (free of any kind of ideology) is available for every body
, the more one's work benefits society, the richer one will be
	ie exactly the opposite of what is happening now, in most parts of the world

obviously, energy is the central issue here
energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego)
and in fact, any kind of intelligence needs energy
