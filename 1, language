our natural lifetime is more or less enough for experiencing life as an individual
besides, we are not our memories, so why bother making them immortal
considering the horrible things that some mortals have done in human history,
	maybe mortality of human beings isn't a bad thing after all,
	at least until they evolve enough
maybe in the future there would be some way to extend human lifetime
also there is the possibility of artificial general intelligence

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_model#Dynamical_systems"

regardless, important thoughts can always be recorded, and every generation can study it and improve it
we may loose our body and personal memories, but our more important thoughts can live for a long time,
	as a collective entity called human knowledge

taxonomic language
Ro philosophical language: "https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.086568442&view=1up&seq=3"
the first consonant of a word indicates the most general concept group, the word belongs to
the subsequent letters are enumerated, to produce the derived words,
	in a way that different words are distinguishable even in noisy environment
the initial vowel of a word determines its part of speech in the sentence
words begin and end in a vowel, this makes word boundaries clear, even when speaking fast
compound words are made by gluing derived words (without initial and final vowels) together

basic concepts:
group, part, truth, negation, numbers, space, time, matter (organic and inorganic), radiation, motion (change)

consonants: (c=ch, x=sh)
, p, b, f, v,    m
, t, d, s, z, l, n, r
, c, j, x,    y
, k, g, h
vowels: a , e, i, o, u (rule)
"a" is usually pronounced as in "car", but alternatively it can be pronounced as in "bad", if it's easier
"aa" can be used to explicitly write the alternative pronunciation

prepositions are like additional arguments for a verb (ie other than the direct object):
	in, on. o, under, towards, before, of, for
verbs are timeless, time is indicated using propositional phrases

conjunctions (or, and, if, then, but, however) connect:
, words or phrases
, dependent clauses
, sentences

subject + verb + adverb + object
the initial vowel of a word determines its part of speech:
, "o": nouns
, "u": proper nouns
, "a": verbs
, "e" or "i": adjectives and adverbs

multiple modifiers (adjectives or adverbs) can apply to the same noun or verb,
	if they are separated by a conjunction, usually "and"
when one modifier immediately follows another of the same type, it modifies the former
	the two together then cumulatively modify the noun or verb headword
cardinal and ordinal number of a noun is treated as adjectives
to make gerund from a verb, just replace initial "a" with "o"
to make passive voice from a verb, replace initial "a" with "e" or "i"

a sequence of nouns must be separated with commas or conjunctions
noun + noun:
, possession
, if the first noun is a gerund, the second noun is its object

there are 6 pronouns
interrogative pronouns: who, what, when, where, why, how

a numbers is one word which begins with the consonant+vowel representing the multiplicity concept,
	followed by consonant+vowels representing the digits, separated with thousand, million ...
