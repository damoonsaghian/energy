artificial intelligence eliminates a lot of complexities
  required for sustaining biological intelligence;
but at least for centuries to come,
  the existence of intelligence will depend on survival of humans;

our basic biological needs are:
, air ie oxygen plus nitrogen and/or helium (to adjust its density),
  with suitable temperature and pressure;
, water ie H2O plus some minerals to (adjust the pH);
, nutrients:
  1, amino acids: L'Lysine HCl (3.58 g), sodium L'Aspartate (6.40 g), L'Leucine (3.83 g),
    L'Threonine (2.42 g), L'Isoleucine (2.42 g), L'Proline (10.33 g), L'Valine (2.67 g),
    Glycine (1.67 g), L'Phenylalanine (1.75 g), L'Serine (5.33 g), L'Arginine HCl (2.58 g),
    L'Tyrosine Ethyl Ester HCl (6.83 g), L'Histidine HCl H2O (1.58 g),
    L'Tryptophan (0.75 g), L'Methionine (1.75 g), L'Glutamine (9.07 g),
    L'Alanine (2.58 g), L'Cysteine Ethyl Ester HCl (0.92 g);
  2, water soluble vitamins: Thiamine HCl (1.00 mg), D'Biotin (0.83 mg), Riboflavin (1.50 mg),
    folic acid (1.67 mg), Pyridoxine HCl (1.67 mg), vitamin C (62.50 mg),
    Niacinamide (10.00 mg), Cyanocobalamin (1.67 mg), Inositol (0.83 mg),
    P'Aminobenzoic acid (416.56 mg), D'Calcium pantothenate (8.33 mg),
    Choline bitartrate (231.25 mg);
  3, salts: Potassium iodide (0.25 mg), Potassium hydroxide (0.83 g),
    Manganous acetate (18.30 mg), Magnesium oxide (0.38 g), Zinc benzoate (2.82 mg),
    Sodium chloride (4.77 g), Cupric acetate (2.50 mg), Ferrous gluconate (0.83 g),
    Sodium glycerophosphate (1.67 mg), Calcium chloride dihydrate (2.44 g),
    Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (5.23 g), Sodium benzoate (1.00 g);
  4, carbohydrates: Glucose (555.0 g), Glucono D'Lactone (17.2 g);
  5, fats and fat soluble vitamins: Ethyl linoleate (2.0 g) A'Tocopherol acetate (57.29 mg),
    vitamin A (3.64 mg) Menadione (4.58 mg) vitamin D (0.057 mg)
  6, maybe other things like fiber which are not really nutrient,
    but are good for digestive system;

naturally the environment we evolved in, supplies our basic needs,
  but it is generally unstable, slow and insufficient
    (considering the current population and standards of life);
thus we have to build machines which can do it faster and in larger amounts;

= future society
in a prosperous society:
, no one's health is threatened by lack of
  clean water, healthy food, shelter, sanitation, or medical services;
, proper education (based on science, and free of any kind of ideology)
  is the right of every one;
, the more one's work benefits society, the more rich one will be
  (ie exactly the opposite of what is happening now, in most parts of the world);

society is made of groups with different specialties;
each group can choose their leaders;
election can in fact be a simple, cheap, dynamic, and completely reliable process;
the only thing we need to completely trust the result of an election,
  is to release the final result in a table;
every one can see if her vote is entered correctly or not;
since the total number of voters is known, there is no place for cheating;
votes are submitted based on anonymous codes
  which only its owner knows of its correspondence with his name;
this method is so simple and cheap that can be easily done in short periods
  (every month or every 3 months);
actually people can vote any time they want, the result table will be updated continuously;
  but the election will be made in discrete periods;
now compare this simple method with what is called democracy nowadays;
actually this is a clear example that shows us
  how the ones in power play with people, and treat them like fools;

= beyond earth
to spread humans beyond earth we need a gigantic craft
  powered by nuclear energy, equipped with ion thrusters,
  containing enough amounts of necessary elements for air, water and food,
    and machines to recycle them;
also there must be machines for mining elements from planets,
  including enough propeller matter to leave planets and navigate through space;
the craft can use the relative movement and gravity of planets, to accelerate and decelerate;
  (gravitational slingshot, gravity assist)

each segment is equipped with its own thruster;
  during taking off most of its volume is used for propeller matter;
in the space this segments connect together as shown in the figure,
  and by rotational motion they provide artificial gravity;
each segment must have a mass equal to the segment at the opposite side
  (i think fluids can be used to compensate small mass inequalities);
in the end we would have two separated regions, unless of course they form a complete cylinder;
