our natural lifetime is more or less enough for experiencing life as an individual;
besides, we are not our memories, so why bother making them immortal;
considering the horrible things that some mortals have done in human history,
  maybe mortality of human beings isn't a bad thing after all,
  at least until they evolve enough;
maybe in the future there would be some way to extend human lifetime;
also there is the possibility of strong artificial intelligence;

regardless, important thoughts can always be recorded,
  and every generation can study it and improve it;
we may loose our body and personal memories,
  but our more important thoughts can live for a long time,
  as a collective entity called human knowledge;

, phones are the exact atomic speech sounds;
, phonemes are a set of similar phones;
phonetic writing systems needs lots of letters, and makes writing needlessly cumbersome;
phonemic systems are enough to make a consistent correspondence between speaking and writing;
phonemic writing system for English, benefits those that are learning it;
but for those that have learned it already, the challenge is to get used to
  the new shapes of words, because in fact we read by seeing the shape of words,
  not by reading single letters;

, f, v, s, z, x (pressure), xx (pleasure);
, tt (thought), dd (that), t, d, b, p, c (charge), j, k, g (get);
, n, m, l, r, w, y (yellow), h;
, u (fun), a (bad), e, i, o, q (food);
, use capital letters for special words (words which are not generic);
, in addition there are numbers and some special symbols;
, tables, diagrams and drawings can help to add clarity to the text;
