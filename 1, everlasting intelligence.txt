maybe in the future there would be some way to extend human lifetime. or maybe strong artificial intelligence and mind uploading will be possible, in the far far future.
but personally i think our natural lifetime is more or less enough for experiencing life as an individual. actually we are not our memories, so why bother making them immortal.
considering the horrible things that some mortals have done in human history, maybe mortality of human beings isn't a bad thing.

important thoughts can always be recorded, and every generation can study it and improve it. we may loose our body and personal memories, but our more important thoughts can live for a long time, as a collective entity called human knowledge.
