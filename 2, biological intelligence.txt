artificial intelligence eliminates a lot of complexities required for sustaining biological intelligence
but at least for centuries to come, the existence of intelligence will depend on survival of humans

our basic biological needs are:
, air ie oxygen plus nitrogen and/or helium (to adjust its density), with suitable temperature and pressure
, water ie H2O plus some minerals (to adjust the pH)
, nutrients:
  1, amino acids: Sodium L'Aspartate (6.40 g), L'Tryptophan (0.75 g),
    L'Threonine (2.42 g), L'Isoleucine (2.42 g), L'Proline (10.33 g), L'Valine (2.67 g),
    Glycine (1.67 g), L'Phenylalanine (1.75 g), L'Serine (5.33 g), L'Leucine (3.83 g),
    L'Methionine (1.75 g), L'Glutamine (9.07 g), L'Alanine (2.58 g),
    L'Arginine HCl (2.58 g), L'Tyrosine Ethyl Ester HCl (6.83 g), L'Lysine HCl (3.58 g),
    L'Histidine HCl H2O (1.58 g), L'Cysteine Ethyl Ester HCl (0.92 g)
  2, water soluble vitamins: vitamin C (62.50 mg), Inositol (0.83 mg), Niacinamide (10.00 mg),
    P'Aminobenzoic acid (416.56 mg), folic acid (1.67 mg), Pyridoxine HCl (1.67 mg), Thiamine HCl (1.00 mg),
    D'Biotin (0.83 mg), Riboflavin (1.50 mg), Cyanocobalamin (1.67 mg),
    D'Calcium pantothenate (8.33 mg), Choline bitartrate (231.25 mg)
  3, salts: Manganous acetate (18.30 mg), Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (5.23 g), Sodium benzoate (1.00 g),
    Zinc benzoate (2.82 mg),  Cupric acetate (2.50 mg), Ferrous gluconate (0.83 g),
    Sodium glycerophosphate (1.67 mg), Calcium chloride dihydrate (2.44 g),
    Sodium chloride (4.77 g), Potassium iodide (0.25 mg), Potassium hydroxide (0.83 g), Magnesium oxide (0.38 g)
  4, carbohydrates: Glucose (555.0 g), Glucono D'Lactone (17.2 g)
  5, fats and fat soluble vitamins: vitamin A (3.64 mg), vitamin D (0.057 mg), Menadione (4.58 mg),
    Ethyl linoleate (2.0 g) A'Tocopherol acetate (57.29 mg)
  6, maybe other things like fiber, which are not nutrients, but are good for digestive system

naturally the environment we evolved in, supplies our basic needs
but in general, it's unstable, slow and insufficient (considering the current population and standards of life)
thus we have to build machines which can do it faster and in larger amounts

= future society
in a prosperous society:
, no one's health is threatened by the lack of
  clean water, healthy food, shelter, sanitation, or medical services
, proper education (based on science, and free of any kind of ideology) is available for every body
, the more one's work benefits society, the more rich one will be
  (ie exactly the opposite of what is happening now, in most parts of the world)

computers can help people to easily access and improve human knowledge,
  and as a result do things to improve the quality of human life
this is what education is all about, or at least it must be
children can learn simple skills useful in everyday life
adolescents can learn more advanced skills, useful for constructing and developing advanced technologies

society is made of groups with different specialties, each group can choose their leaders
election can in fact be a simple, cheap, dynamic, and completely reliable process
the only thing we need to completely trust the result of an election,
  is to release the final result in a table
every one can see if her vote is entered correctly or not
since the total number of voters is known, there is no place for cheating
votes are submitted based on anonymous code which only its owner knows of its correspondence with his name
this method is so simple and cheap that can be easily done in short periods (every month or every 3 months)
actually people can vote any time they want, the result table will be updated continuously
  but the election will be made in discrete periods
now compare this simple method with what we call democracy nowadays
this clearly shows us how the ones in power, play with people, and treat them like fools

= beyond earth
to spread humans beyond earth we need a gigantic craft powered by nuclear energy, equipped with ion thrusters,
  containing enough amounts of necessary elements for air, water and food, and machines to recycle them
also there must be machines for mining elements from planets,
  including enough propeller matter to leave planets and navigate through space
the craft can use the relative movement and gravity of planets, to accelerate and decelerate
  (gravitational slingshot, gravity assist)

".data/spacecraft.png"
each segment is equipped with its own thruster
during taking off most of its volume is used for propeller matter
in the space this segments connect together as shown in the figure,
  and by rotational motion they provide artificial gravity
each segment must have a mass equal to the segment at the opposite side
  (i think fluids can be used to compensate small mass inequalities)
in the end we would have two separated regions, unless of course they form a complete cylinder
