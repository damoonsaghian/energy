everlasting intelligence needs everlasting energy
indeed there is only one source of energy which is inexhaustible, the nucleus of abundant elements

# sun
we live because of the sun, and because we are far enough from it, but this also means that the energy is dispersed on earth and to harness it we need a lot of space
concentrated solar power is a good method to do it
Img("solar tower.png")
though instead of heating water in tubes by sunlight we can use the equivalent natural systems
1, water cycle which its use is almost saturated
2, high altitude wind, like Magenn air rotor system

# energy storage
we can store energy in the electron arrangement of special materials
they are called batteries or fuels, if the released energy is electricity or heat, respectively
flow battery, regenerative fuel cell
supercapacitor
fossil fuels are how nature does this they have very good energy densities but burning them pollutes air, and their natural resources will eventually expire
biofuel is a ridiculous, and at the same time a sad lie, it leads to more hunger, and it is the most inefficient way to harness the energy of the sun

# nuclear energy
imitating what happens in the sun, iE ramming two mutually repelling nuclei together, a process called fusion, is extremely hard to confine in systems smaller than stars
currently the most common way to harness nuclear energy is by splitting a heavy nucleus apart, a process called fission, which in addition to not being an abundant energy source, is in general a very dirty process, producing a lot of highly radioactive wastes, though maybe new generation reactors can solve these problems partially at least
it would be great if we could harness nuclear energy directly and safely, because energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego)

# WidomLarsen theory
it seems that clean and abundant nuclear energy might be possible, according to WidomLarsen theory
we know that offering low momentum neutrons to nuclei of atoms initiates nuclear reactions which release energy, generally neutron capture and beta decay processes
but how can we generate these neutrons without expending more energy than the process yields
it seems that there is a way thanks to a theory by Allan Widom and Lewis Larsen

we start by processing a metal such that it can hold hydrogen the way a sponge holds water
then electrons in the metal are made to oscillate together in such a way that the electromagnetic energy stored in tens of thousands of them is transferred to a relative few, giving them enough energy to merge with nearby protons (or deuterons, if present) and produce low momentum neutrons
there is an energy cost of 0.78e6 eV to create a neutron from a proton, lack of this energy is why there is no neutron production in usual condensed matter systems, but once the threshold is reached, calculations show that there is a robust production rate for low momentum neutrons
the hitch is creating the right oscillation, it seems that the required frequencies are in a valley of inaccessibility about 5e12 to 30e12 hertz
under exactly the right conditions ie
  , contiguous manyBody monolayer patch of entangled collectively oscillating protons on a surface
  , entangled collectively oscillating surface plasmon electrons
  , local breakdown of BornOppenheimer approximation
  , nonEquilibrium energy input
  , and when local nanoscale electric fields in a patch exceed 2e11 volt/meter
  then some number of the surface plasmon electrons located in such a patch will have high enough renormalized masses to react directly with nearby protons producing neutrons

collectively produced neutrons will have extremely large quantum wavelengths (depending on dimensions of a given patch, from around 2 nanoMeters to perhaps 100 microns) and will be captured locally within picoseconds, they generally do not have enough time to thermalize which requires a few tenths of a milliSecond
prompt and delayed gammas between 0.5 to 1 mega electronVolt up through 10 to 11 mega electonVolt resulting from captures or subsequent decay processes, are locally converted directly into infrared photons, by the population of unreacted, entangled heavy electrons present in a patch

producing neutrons via WidomLarsen electroweak reactions requires a threshold minimum local electric field of at least 2e11 volt/meter, this is a typical nuclearStrength eField seen by inner electrons in unIonized atomic nuclei, for example the electric field strength at a Bohr radius, about 0.5 angstrom away from an isolated proton is roughly 5e11 volt/meter
when BornOppenheimer approximation breaks down on various types of surfaces, local electromagnetic coupling between films of collectively oscillating surface plasmon electrons (eg on metals) or pElectrons (eG on aromatic rings, graphene, etc) and nearby collectively oscillating surface patches of protons or deuterons, can theoretically create an estimated electric field in the immediate vicinity of the patch on the order of 28.8e11 v/m, this value is well above bare minimum electric field threshold for WidomLarsen neutron production via e*+p or e*+d electroweak reactions
some have expressed concerns that this theoretical electric field strength estimate may be unphysical in it being hard to exceed 2e11 v/m in the real world, such fears are groundless, local electrical fields > 1e11 v/m are readily created on tiny subNano to microMeter scales
BornOppenheimer is well known to break down on metal surfaces, however the magnitude of BornOppenheimer breakdown may vary widely from one chemical system to another
manyBody collective oscillations and mutual quantum entanglement of protons and electrons (eg sP electrons on metallic hydride surfaces) in conjunction with a breakdown of the BornOppenheimer approximation, appear to be relatively common in nature, occurring in many different types of physical systems, see these papers for example
, CA Chatzidimitriou Dreismann "attosecond quantum entanglement in neutron compton scattering from water in the kev range"
, JD Jost "entangled mechanical oscillators"
while these manyBody collective processes operate very rapidly, and nanoscale coherence can only persist for time spans of 1e-15 to 1e-18 sec, nuclear processes such as weak interaction uLM neutron production and neutron capture operate on even faster time scales, about 1e-19 to 1e-22 second
it is well known that metallic surface nanostructures and sP electrons can have configurations that are able to effectively absorb electromagnetic energy over a wide area, transfer and concentrate it, and in conjunction with contiguous surface patches of collectively oscillating protons create nuclearStrength local electric fields, uLM neutron production can then follow
, collective oscillations and quantum entanglement of manyBody patches of protons located on metallic surfaces or with hydrogenous atoms bonded to carbon atoms, in certain structural configurations (aromatic rings, fullerenes, graphene)
, creation of nuclearStrength electric fields on small length scales caused by local breakdown of BornOppenheimer approximation
, mass renormalization (eSP + manyBody collective field energy e*) of entangled surface plasmon electrons, or equivalently, delocalized pElectrons present in certain carbon based molecular structures, in extremely high local electric fields found in patches, once certain fieldStrength thresholds are surpassed, production of mostly ultra low momentum neutrons via e*+p weak reactions, can occur (also emitting electron neutrinos)
almost all uLM neutrons are captured locally, creating complex, dynamic neutron catalyzed lENR nucleosynthetic networks that can produce many products, and release energy
it is well known that metallic surface nanostructures and sPP electrons can have configurations that are able to effectively absorb electromagnetic energy over a wide area, transfer and concentrate it, and in conjunction with contiguous surface patches of collectively oscillating protons, create extremely high local electric fields
  see "entangled mechanical oscillators, nature 459 2009" by JD Jost etAl, in which mechanical vibration of two ion pairs separated by a few hundred micrometres, is entangled in a quantum way
1, manyBody patches of collectively oscillating protons (or deuterons) formed on metallic hydride surfaces loaded with hydrogen isotopes
2, the BornOppenheimer approximation breaks down in the local region above the patches, collective oscillations of the protons start to couple loosely to the collective oscillations of nearby surface plasmon polariton (sPP) electrons, commonly found on surfaces of metals
3, coupling between sPP electrons and the patches of protons increases the local electric field to values more than 10e11 volt/meter, roughly the same magnitude as electric fields seen by inner electrons in atomic nuclei
4, intense local radiation field raises effective mass of sPP electrons so that they can react spontaneously with nearby protons or deuterons to create neutrons
5, neutrons created collectively have huge quantum mechanical wavelengths (microns) and are almost always absorbed locally by nearby nuclei
6, heavyMass sPP electrons in condensed matter systems have the unique ability to directly absorb a gamma photon and reRadiate it as a collection of much lower energy infrared and soft xRay photons, as a result, lENR systems have builtIn gamma shields that preclude external emission of hard radiation in the form of mega eV gamma rays
in a nutshell, the plasmon modes in hydrated metals (think of them as surface electrons that all act together) get energized (many ways to do this) and get absorbed by protons, this produces very low energy neutrons which get absorbed quite easily by anything
this starts a cascade of creating unstable isotopes which beta decay, during the beta decay, gamma ray photons are released, but when they hit that metal plasmon they get shifted into mostly infrared with a soft xRay tail
the challenge is that this phenomena requires very high energy densities, order of 1e11 volt/meter, so it more often will happen in small nanoCrevices in materials
1, in condensed matter, local breakdown of the BornOppenheimer approximation occurs in homogeneous, manyBody, collectively oscillating patches of protons found on surfaces of fully loaded metallic hydrides, BornOppenheimer breakdown enables a degree of electromagnetic coupling of surface proton oscillations with those of nearby surface plasmon polariton (sPP) electrons
2, such coupling between collective oscillations creates local nuclearStrength electric fields in the vicinity of the patches
3, sPP electrons bathed in such high fields increase their effective mass, thus becoming heavy electrons
4, heavy app electrons can react directly with protons located in surface patches, through an inverse beta decay process that results in simultaneous collective production of a neutron and a neutrino
5, collectively produced neutrons are created ultra cold, that is they have ultra low momentum and extremely large quantum mechanical wavelengths, and absorption crossSections compared to typical neutrons at thermal energies
6, heavy sPP patch electrons are uniquely able to immediately convert almost any locally produced or incident gamma radiation, directly into infrared heat energy, thus providing a form of builtIn gamma shielding for the nuclear reactions
on the surface of a metallic hydride cell with surface plasmon polariton modes, protons collectively oscillate along with the electrons, hence the BornOppenheimer approximation which assumes that the proton is rigidly fixed, breaks down and should not be employed
in other words, neutron production is the result of collective electromagnetic coupling caused by breakdown of the BornOppenheimer approximation that occurs between two types of intrinsically collective oscillations found on metallic hydride surfaces
1, surface plasmon polariton (sPP) electrons (which determine colors of metals)
2, contiguous, coherent surface patches of protons or deuterons that can form on hydrogen loaded hydrides
such coupling helps to create very high local fields greater than 10e11 volt/meter that can renormalize masses of polariton electrons above threshold for ultra low momentum neutron production

elements heavier than iron are thought to be created via nucleosynthesis reactions (neutron capture and subsequent beta decays of unstable neutronRich isotopes) in stars
two types of such neutron capture processes thought to occur in hot stellar plasmas
, sProcess (slow) occurs in stars (eg red giants) with neutron flux 10e5 to 10e11 cm^2/sec
, rProcess (rapid) occurs in supernova explosions with neutron flux greater than 10e22 cm^2/sec
according to WidomLarsen similar processes occurs in condensed matter lENR systems where neutron flux can be 1e9 to 1e16 cm^2/sec
the difference is that neutrons in lENR systems can be ultra low momentum and thus have vastly larger absorption crossSections
since 1989, certain researchers in lENR have documented genuine anomalies that occur in various types of heavy and light hydrogen experimental systems, all involving heavily loaded metallic hydrides
1, production of a broad array of different stable isotopic transmutation products
2, different types of nuclear effects triggered by electrical current, laser, rF, and pressure
3, calorimetrically measured excess heat effects in wide range of values from just milliWatts to tens of watts in some cases
4, production of helium isotopes, rarely detect tritium
5, production of modest fluxes of mega eV alpha particles and protons, as well as some minuscule fluxes of low energy x and gamma ray photons (no fluxes of hard mega eV gammas)
the best experimental evidence for WidomLarsen theory is this
  simple twoParameter optical model of uLM neutron absorption based on WidomLarsen theory of lENR predicts 5 peaks for product isotopic abundance, which matches very well with experimental results
mass spectroscopy probably the best analytical technique for diagnosing presence of lENR by the early to mid 1990s maverick lENR researchers, located at a smattering of major universities and national laboratories in Japan, Russia, Italy, and the United States, were already doing competent beforeAndAfter analyses of experimental lENR devices, using various types of mass spectroscopy and (mainly at conferences) reporting the appearance of many new elements not initially present at the beginning of experiments, and/or substantial isotopic shifts in stable isotopes of elements initially present that could not reasonably be explained by contamination, andOr the action of prosaic chemical isotopic fractionation processes
some apostate lENR researchers using sIMS to assay isotopes postExperiment, were even able to spatially correlate elemental or isotopic anomalies, with distinctive morphological features observed on postExperiment metallic device surfaces
unusual structures found at such locations often consisted of micronScale craters and other odd morphologies indicative of locally explosive flash melting or boiling events
  see George Miley "distinctive 5 peak ni/h2O transmutation product mass spectrum" published in 1996 (mostly sIMS and neutron activation analyses data)
why is the sunS corona so much hotter than the sunS surface, this coronal heating problem is still an unresolved problem of physics, can it be because of low energy nuclear reactions discussed above
this theory may be able to explain the strange nuclear reactions observed in exploding wires, lightnings, strong flux of lowEnergy neutrons produced by thunderstorms (http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v108/i12/e125001) and fracturing piezoelectric rocks
