to spread beyond earth we need a gigantic craft powered by nuclear energy equipped with ion thrusters, containing enough amounts of necessary elements for air, water and food, and machines to recycle them
also there must be machines for mining elements from planets, including enough propeller matter to leave planets and navigate through space
also the craft can use the relative movement and gravity of planets to accelerate and decelerate (gravitational slingshot, gravity assist)

each segment is equipped with its own thruster, during taking off most of its volume is used for propeller matter
in the space this segments connect together as depicted below and by rotational motion they provide artificial gravity
each segment must have a mass equal to the segment at the opposite side, for example by using fluids to compensate small mass inequalities, so we have two separated regions unless of course they form a complete cylinder
artificial intelligence eliminates a lot of complexities required for sustaining biological intelligence
