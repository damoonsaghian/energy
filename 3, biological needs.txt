at least for centuries to come, the existence of intelligence on earth will depend on survival of humans.
our basic biological needs are:
, air ie oxygen plus nitrogen and/or helium to adjust its density, with suitable temperature and pressure
, water ie H2O plus some minerals to adjust the pH
, nutrients:
1, amino acids: L_Lysine HCl (3.58 g), sodium L_Aspartate (6.40 g), L_Leucine (3.83 g), L_Threonine (2.42 g), L_Isoleucine (2.42 g), L_Proline (10.33 g), L_Valine (2.67 g), Glycine (1.67 g), L_Phenylalanine (1.75 g), L_Serine (5.33 g), L_Arginine HCl (2.58 g), L_Tyrosine Ethyl Ester HCl (6.83 g), L_Histidine HCl H2O (1.58 g), L_Tryptophan (0.75 g), L_Methionine (1.75 g), L_Glutamine (9.07 g), L_Alanine (2.58 g), L_Cysteine Ethyl Ester HCl (0.92 g)

5, fats and fat soluble vitamins: Ethyl linoleate (2.0 g) A_Tocopherol acetate (57.29 mg), vitamin A (3.64 mg) Menadione (4.58 mg) vitamin D (0.057 mg)
6, maybe other things like fiber which are not really nutrient, but are good for digestive system

naturally the environment we evolved in, supplies our basic needs, but it is generally unstable, slow and insufficient (considering the current population and standards of life). thus we have to build machines which can do it faster and in larger amounts.
