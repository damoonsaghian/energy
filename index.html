<h2>2, biological intelligence</h2><div>artificial intelligence eliminates a lot of complexities</div><div>  required for sustaining biological intelligence;</div><div>but at least for centuries to come,</div><div>  the existence of intelligence will depend on survival of humans;</div><div><p></p></div><div>our basic biological needs are:</div><div>, air ie oxygen plus nitrogen and/or helium (to adjust its density),</div><div>  with suitable temperature and pressure;</div><div>, water ie H2O plus some minerals to (adjust the pH);</div><div>, nutrients:</div><div>  1, amino acids: L_Lysine HCl (3.58 g), sodium L_Aspartate (6.40 g), L_Leucine (3.83 g),</div><div>    L_Threonine (2.42 g), L_Isoleucine (2.42 g), L_Proline (10.33 g), L_Valine (2.67 g),</div><div>    Glycine (1.67 g), L_Phenylalanine (1.75 g), L_Serine (5.33 g), L_Arginine HCl (2.58 g),</div><div>    L_Tyrosine Ethyl Ester HCl (6.83 g), L_Histidine HCl H2O (1.58 g),</div><div>    L_Tryptophan (0.75 g), L_Methionine (1.75 g), L_Glutamine (9.07 g),</div><div>    L_Alanine (2.58 g), L_Cysteine Ethyl Ester HCl (0.92 g);</div><div>  2, water soluble vitamins: Thiamine HCl (1.00 mg), D_Biotin (0.83 mg), Riboflavin (1.50 mg),</div><div>    folic acid (1.67 mg), Pyridoxine HCl (1.67 mg), vitamin C (62.50 mg),</div><div>    Niacinamide (10.00 mg), Cyanocobalamin (1.67 mg), Inositol (0.83 mg),</div><div>    P_Aminobenzoic acid (416.56 mg), D_Calcium pantothenate (8.33 mg),</div><div>    Choline bitartrate (231.25 mg);</div><div>  3, salts: Potassium iodide (0.25 mg), Potassium hydroxide (0.83 g),</div><div>    Manganous acetate (18.30 mg), Magnesium oxide (0.38 g), Zinc benzoate (2.82 mg),</div><div>    Sodium chloride (4.77 g), Cupric acetate (2.50 mg), Ferrous gluconate (0.83 g),</div><div>    Sodium glycerophosphate (1.67 mg), Calcium chloride dihydrate (2.44 g),</div><div>    Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (5.23 g), Sodium benzoate (1.00 g);</div><div>  4, carbohydrates: Glucose (555.0 g), Glucono D_Lactone (17.2 g);</div><div>  5, fats and fat soluble vitamins: Ethyl linoleate (2.0 g) A_Tocopherol acetate (57.29 mg),</div><div>    vitamin A (3.64 mg) Menadione (4.58 mg) vitamin D (0.057 mg)</div><div>  6, maybe other things like fiber which are not really nutrient,</div><div>    but are good for digestive system;</div><div><p></p></div><div>naturally the environment we evolved in, supplies our basic needs,</div><div>  but it is generally unstable, slow and insufficient</div><div>    (considering the current population and standards of life);</div><div>thus we have to build machines which can do it faster and in larger amounts;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>future society</b></div><div>in a prosperous society:</div><div>, no one's health is threatened by lack of</div><div>  clean water, healthy food, shelter, sanitation, or medical services;</div><div>, proper education (based on science, without any kind of ideology)</div><div>  is the right of every one;</div><div>, the more one's work benefits society, the more rich one will be</div><div>  (ie exactly the opposite of what is happening now, in most countries);</div><div><p></p></div><div>society is made of groups with different specialties;</div><div>each group can choose their leaders;</div><div>election can in fact be a simple, cheap, dynamic, and completely reliable process;</div><div>the only thing we need to completely trust the result of an election,</div><div>  is to release the final result in a table;</div><div>every one can see if her vote is entered correctly or not;</div><div>  (votes are submitted based on anonymous codes</div><div>    which only its owner knows of its correspondence with his name)</div><div>since the total number of voters is known, the result is completely reliable;</div><div>  there is no place for cheating in this method;</div><div>this method is so simple and cheap that can be easily done in short periods</div><div>  (every month or every 3 months);</div><div>actually people can vote any time they want, the result table will be updated continuously;</div><div>  but the election will be made in discrete periods;</div><div>now compare this simple method with what is called democracy nowadays;</div><div>actually this is a clear example that shows us</div><div>  how the ones in power play with people and treat them like fools;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>beyond earth</b></div><div>to spread humans beyond earth we need a gigantic craft</div><div>  powered by nuclear energy, equipped with ion thrusters,</div><div>  containing enough amounts of necessary elements for air, water and food,</div><div>    and machines to recycle them;</div><div>also there must be machines for mining elements from planets,</div><div>  including enough propeller matter to leave planets and navigate through space;</div><div>the craft can use the relative movement and gravity of planets,</div><div>  to accelerate and decelerate; (gravitational slingshot, gravity assist)</div><div><p></p></div><div><img src='spacecraft.png' alt='spacecraft.png'/></div><div>each segment is equipped with its own thruster;</div><div>  during taking off most of its volume is used for propeller matter;</div><div>in the space this segments connect together as shown in the figure,</div><div>  and by rotational motion they provide artificial gravity;</div><div>each segment must have a mass equal to the segment at the opposite side</div><div>  (i think fluids can be used to compensate small mass inequalities);</div><div>in the end we would have two separated regions,</div><div>  unless of course they form a complete cylinder;</div>
<h2>3, everlasting energy</h2><div>i think energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego);</div><div>it seems that there is only one source of energy which is inexhaustible,</div><div>  the nucleus of abundant elements;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>Sun</b></div><div>we live because of the Sun, and because we are far enough from it;</div><div>but this also means that the energy is dispersed on earth</div><div>  and to harness it we need a lot of space;</div><div>solar power tower is a good method to do it;</div><div><img src='solar tower.png' alt='solar tower.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>additionally we can use natural cyclic systems powered by sun:</div><div>, water cycle, which its use is almost saturated;</div><div>, high altitude wind, like Magenn air rotor system;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>energy storage</b></div><div>we can store energy in the electron arrangement of special materials;</div><div>they are called batteries or fuels,</div><div>  if the released energy is electricity or heat, respectively;</div><div><p></p></div><div>flow battery, regenerative fuel cell;</div><div>super_capacitor;</div><div><p></p></div><div>fossil fuels are how nature does this; they have very good energy densities, but</div><div>  burning them pollutes air, and their natural resources will eventually expire;</div><div>biofuel is a ridiculous, and at the same time a sad, lie;</div><div>  it leads to more hunger, and it is the most inefficient way to harness the energy of the sun;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>nuclear energy</b></div><div>everlasting intelligence requires everlasting energy;</div><div>so we need to harness nuclear energy directly;</div><div><p></p></div><div>currently the most common way to harness nuclear energy is by</div><div>  splitting a heavy nucleus apart (a process called fission),</div><div>  which in addition to not being an abundant energy source,</div><div>  is in general a very dirty process, producing high_level nuclear waste;</div><div>though maybe new generation reactors can solve these problems (partially at least);</div><div><p></p></div><div>fusion:</div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetized_Liner_Inertial_Fusion'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetized_Liner_Inertial_Fusion</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-reversed_configuration'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-reversed_configuration</a></div><div><a href='https://fusionenergy.lanl.gov/Documents/MTF/seab-siemon%20april%2099.pdf'>https://fusionenergy.lanl.gov/Documents/MTF/seab-siemon%20april%2099.pdf</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma-facing_material'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma-facing_material</a></div><div>  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Health_hazards_and_protection'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Health_hazards_and_protection</a></div>
