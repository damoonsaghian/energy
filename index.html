<h2>1, humans</h2><div>artificial intelligence eliminates a lot of complexities required for sustaining biological intelligence</div><div>but at least for centuries to come, the existence of intelligence on earth will depend on survival of humankind</div><div><p></p></div><div>our basic biological needs are:</div><div>, air (oxygen plus nitrogen and/or helium to adjust its density, with suitable temperature and pressure)</div><div>, clean water (H2O plus some minerals to adjust the pH)</div><div>, nutrients</div><div>	<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_(meal_replacement)'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_(meal_replacement)</a></div><div>	<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huel'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huel</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>naturally the environment we evolved in, supplies our basic needs</div><div>but in general, it's unstable, slow and insufficient (considering the current population and standards of life)</div><div>thus we have to find methods to do it faster and in larger amounts, without damaging our environment</div><div><p></p></div><div>in a prosperous society:</div><div>, no one's health is threatened by the lack of</div><div>	clean water, healthy food, shelter, sanitation, or medical services</div><div>, proper education (free of any kind of ideology) is available for every body</div><div>, the more one's work benefits society, the richer one will be</div><div>	ie exactly the opposite of what is happening now, in most parts of the world</div>
<h2>2, energy</h2><div>energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego)</div><div>but in fact any kind of intelligence needs energy</div><div>it seems that there is only one source of energy which is inexhaustible, the nucleus of abundant elements</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>Sun</b></div><div>we live because of the Sun, and because we are far enough from it</div><div>but this also means that the energy is dispersed on earth and to harness it we need a lot of space</div><div>solar power tower is a good method to do it</div><div><img src='solar-tower.png' alt='solar-tower.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>additionally we can use natural cyclic systems powered by the Sun:</div><div>, water cycle, which its use is almost saturated</div><div>, high altitude wind, like Magenn air rotor system</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>energy storage</b></div><div>we can store energy in the electron arrangement of special materials</div><div>they are called batteries or fuels, if the released energy is electricity or heat, respectively</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>fossil fuels are how nature stores energy, they have very good energy densities,</div><div>	but burning them pollutes air, and their natural resources will eventually expire</div><div>biofuel is a ridiculous and at the same time a sad lie</div><div>	it leads to more hunger, and it is the most inefficient way to harness the energy of the Sun</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>nuclear energy</b></div><div>to export intelligence beyond the solar system, we need to harness nuclear energy directly</div><div><p></p></div><div>currently the most common way to harness nuclear energy is by splitting a heavy nucleus apart,</div><div>	a process called fission</div><div>in addition to not being an abundant energy source, fission is in general a very dirty process,</div><div>	producing high'level nuclear waste</div><div>though maybe new generation reactors can solve these problems (partially at least)</div><div><p></p></div><div>fusion:</div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetized_Liner_Inertial_Fusion'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetized_Liner_Inertial_Fusion</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma-facing_material'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma-facing_material</a></div><div>	<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Health_hazards_and_protection'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Health_hazards_and_protection</a></div><div>quantum gravity -&gt; controlling gravity? -&gt; fusion</div></body></html>
