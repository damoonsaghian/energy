<h2>3, everlasting energy</h2><div>it seems that there is only one source of energy which is inexhaustible,</div><div>  the nucleus of abundant elements;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>Sun</b></div><div>we live because of the Sun, and because we are far enough from it;</div><div>but this also means that the energy is dispersed on earth</div><div>  and to harness it we need a lot of space;</div><div>solar power tower is a good method to do it;</div><div><img src='solar tower.png' alt='solar tower.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>additionally we can use natural cyclic systems powered by sun:</div><div>, water cycle, which its use is almost saturated;</div><div>, high altitude wind, like Magenn air rotor system;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>energy storage</b></div><div>we can store energy in the electron arrangement of special materials;</div><div>they are called batteries or fuels,</div><div>  if the released energy is electricity or heat, respectively;</div><div><p></p></div><div>flow battery, regenerative fuel cell;</div><div>super_capacitor;</div><div><p></p></div><div>fossil fuels are how nature does this; they have very good energy densities, but</div><div>  burning them pollutes air, and their natural resources will eventually expire;</div><div>biofuel is a ridiculous, and at the same time a sad, lie;</div><div>  it leads to more hunger, and it is the most inefficient way to harness the energy of the sun;</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>nuclear energy</b></div><div>imitating what happens in the sun,</div><div>  ie ramming two (mutually repelling) nuclei together (a process called fusion),</div><div>  is extremely hard to confine in systems smaller than stars;</div><div><p></p></div><div>currently the most common way to harness nuclear energy is by</div><div>  splitting a heavy nucleus apart (a process called fission),</div><div>  which in addition to not being an abundant energy source,</div><div>  is in general a very dirty process, producing a lot of highly radioactive wastes;</div><div>though maybe new generation reactors can solve these problems (partially at least);</div><div><p></p></div><div>anyway, it would be great if we could harness nuclear energy directly and safely,</div><div>  because energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego);</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>WidomLarsen theory</b></div><div>it seems that clean and abundant nuclear energy might be possible,</div><div>  according to WidomLarsen theory;</div><div>we know that offering low momentum neutrons to nuclei (lighter than iron)</div><div>  initiates nuclear reactions (generally neutron capture and beta decay)</div><div>  which releases energy;</div><div>but how can we generate these neutrons without expending more energy than the process yields;</div><div>it seems that there may be a way, thanks to a theory by Allan Widom and Lewis Larsen;</div><div><p></p></div><div>BornOppenheimer approximation is known to break down on metal surfaces;</div><div>  however the magnitude of BornOppenheimer breakdown may vary widely</div><div>    from one chemical system to another;</div><div>breakdown of BornOppenheimer approximation</div><div>  in the contiguous patches formed on fully loaded metallic hydride surfaces,</div><div>  enables collective oscillations of the protons to couple loosely</div><div>  to the collective oscillations of nearby surface plasmon polariton (SPP) electrons,</div><div>    commonly found on surfaces of metals;</div><div>see "CA Chatzidimitriou Dreismann, atto_second quantum entanglement</div><div>  in neutron Compton scattering from water in the k_eV range";</div><div>see "JD Jost et_al, entangled mechanical oscillators, nature 459 2009",</div><div>  in which mechanical vibration of two ion pairs separated by a few hundred micrometers,</div><div>    is entangled;</div><div>coupling between SPP electrons and the patches of protons</div><div>  increases the local electric field to values more than 10e11 volt/meter,</div><div>  roughly the same magnitude as electric fields seen by inner electrons in atomic nuclei;</div><div>intense local field raises effective mass of SPP electrons,</div><div>  so that they can react spontaneously with nearby protons</div><div>  to create ultra_low_momentum (ULM) neutrons;</div><div><p></p></div><div>neutrons created collectively</div><div>  have huge quantum mechanical wavelengths (2 nano_meters to microns)</div><div>  and are almost always absorbed locally by nearby nuclei within picoseconds;</div><div>  (they generally do not have enough time to thermalize</div><div>    which requires a few tenths of a milli_second)</div><div>while these many_body collective processes operate very rapidly,</div><div>  and nano_scale coherence can only persist for time spans of 1e-15 to 1e-18 sec,</div><div>  nuclear processes such as weak interaction ULM neutron production and neutron capture</div><div>    operate on even faster time scales, about 1e-19 to 1e-22 second;</div><div><p></p></div><div>heavy_mass SPP electrons in condensed matter systems</div><div>  have the unique ability to directly absorb a gamma photon</div><div>  and re_radiate it as a collection of much lower energy infrared and soft x_ray photons,</div><div>  thus providing a form of built_in gamma shielding;</div><div><p></p></div><div>see these papers by A Widom and L Larsen:</div><div>, "ultra low momentum neutron catalyzed nuclear reactions on metallic hydride surfaces"</div><div>  <a

theory</b></div><div>since 1989, certain researchers in LENR have documented genuine anomalies</div><div>  that occur in various types of experiments,</div><div>  all involving heavily loaded metallic hydrides:</div><div>1, production of a broad array of different stable isotopic transmutation products;</div><div>2, different types of nuclear effects triggered</div><div>  by electrical current, laser, RF, and pressure;</div><div>3, calorimetrically measured excess heat effects in wide range of values</div><div>  from just milli_Watts to tens of watts in some cases;</div><div>4, production of
