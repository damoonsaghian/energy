<h2>2, biological intelligence</h2><div>artificial intelligence eliminates a lot of complexities required for sustaining biological intelligence</div><div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science</div><div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_model#Dynamical_systems</div><div>but at least for centuries to come, the existence of intelligence will depend on survival of humans</div><div><p></p></div><div>our basic biological needs are:</div><div>, air ie oxygen plus nitrogen and/or helium (to adjust its density), with suitable temperature and pressure</div><div>, water ie H2O plus some minerals (to adjust the pH)</div><div>, nutrients:</div><div>  1, amino acids: Sodium L'Aspartate (6.40 g), L'Tryptophan (0.75

href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huel'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huel</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>naturally the environment we evolved in, supplies our basic needs</div><div>but in general, it's unstable, slow and insufficient (considering the current population and standards of life)</div><div>thus we have to build machines which can do it faster and in larger amounts</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>future society</b></div><div>in a prosperous society:</div><div>, no one's health is threatened by the lack of</div><div>  clean water, healthy food, shelter, sanitation, or medical services</div><div>, proper education (based on science, and free of any kind of ideology) is available for every body</div><div>, the more one's work benefits society, the more rich one will be</div><div>  (ie exactly the opposite of what is happening now, in most parts of the world)</div><div><p></p></div><div>computers can help people to easily access and improve human knowledge,</div><div>  and as a result do things to improve the quality of human life</div><div>this is what education is all about, or at least it must be</div><div>children can learn simple skills useful in everyday life</div><div>adolescents can learn more advanced skills, useful for constructing and developing advanced technologies</div><div><p></p></div><div>society is made of groups with different specialties, each group can choose their leaders</div><div>election can in fact be a simple, cheap, dynamic, and completely reliable process</div><div>the only thing we need to completely trust the result of an election,</div><div>  is to release the final result in a table</div><div>every one can see if her vote is entered correctly or not</div><div>since the total number of voters is known, there is no place for cheating</div><div>votes are submitted based on anonymous code which only its owner knows of its correspondence with his name</div><div>this method is so simple and cheap that can be easily done in short periods (every month or every 3 months)</div><div>actually people can vote any time they want, the result table will be updated continuously</div><div>  but the election will be made in discrete periods</div><div>now compare this simple method with what we call democracy nowadays</div><div>this clearly shows us how the ones in power, play with people, and treat them like fools</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>beyond earth</b></div><div>to spread humans beyond earth we need a gigantic craft powered by nuclear energy, equipped with ion thrusters,</div><div>  containing enough amounts of necessary elements for air, water and food, and machines to recycle them</div><div>also there must be machines for mining elements from planets,</div><div>  including enough propeller matter to leave planets and navigate through space</div><div>the craft can use the relative movement and gravity of planets, to accelerate and decelerate</div><div>  (gravitational slingshot, gravity assist)</div><div><p></p></div><div><img src='spacecraft.png' alt='spacecraft.png'/></div><div>each segment is equipped with its own thruster</div><div>during taking off most of its volume is used for propeller matter</div><div>in the space this segments connect together as shown in the figure,</div><div>  and by rotational motion they provide artificial gravity</div><div>each segment must have a mass equal to the segment at the opposite side</div><div>  (i think fluids can be used to compensate small mass inequalities)</div><div>in the end we would have two separated regions, unless of course they form a complete cylinder</div>
<h2>3, everlasting energy</h2><div>i think energy is the second major problem of humankind (the first is our ego)</div><div>it seems that there is only one source of energy which is inexhaustible, the nucleus of abundant elements</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>Sun</b></div><div>we live because of the Sun, and because we are far enough from it</div><div>but this also means that the energy is dispersed on earth and to harness it we need a lot of space</div><div>solar power tower is a good method to do it</div><div><img src='solar-tower.png' alt='solar-tower.png'/></div><div><p></p></div><div>additionally we can use natural cyclic systems powered by the Sun:</div><div>, water cycle, which its use is almost saturated</div><div>, high altitude wind, like Magenn air rotor system</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>energy storage</b></div><div>we can store energy in the electron arrangement of special materials</div><div>they are called batteries or fuels, if the released energy is electricity or heat, respectively</div><div><p></p></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery</a></div><div><p></p></div><div>fossil fuels are how nature stores energy, they have very good energy densities,</div><div>  but burning them pollutes air, and their natural resources will eventually expire</div><div>biofuel is a ridiculous and at the same time a sad lie</div><div>  it leads to more hunger, and it is the most inefficient way to harness the energy of the Sun</div><div><p></p></div><div><b>nuclear energy</b></div><div>everlasting intelligence requires everlasting energy</div><div>so we need to harness nuclear energy directly</div><div><p></p></div><div>currently the most common way to harness nuclear energy is</div><div>  by splitting a heavy nucleus apart (a process called fission),</div><div>  which in addition to not being an abundant energy source,</div><div>  is in general a very dirty process, producing high'level nuclear waste</div><div>though maybe new generation reactors can solve these problems (partially at least)</div><div><p></p></div><div>fusion:</div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetized_Liner_Inertial_Fusion'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetized_Liner_Inertial_Fusion</a></div><div><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma-facing_material'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma-facing_material</a></div><div>  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Health_hazards_and_protection'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Health_hazards_and_protection</a></div></body></html>
