our natural lifetime is more or less enough for experiencing life as an individual;
besides, we are not our memories, so why bother making them immortal;
considering the horrible things that some mortals have done in human history,
  maybe mortality of human beings isn't a bad thing after all,
  at least until they evolve enough;
maybe in the future there would be some way to extend human lifetime;
also there is the possibility of strong artificial intelligence;

regardless, important thoughts can always be recorded, and every generation can study it and improve it;
we may loose our body and personal memories, but our more important thoughts can live for a long time,
  as a collective entity called human knowledge;
