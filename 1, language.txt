our natural lifetime is more or less enough for experiencing life as an individual;
besides, we are not our memories, so why bother making them immortal;
considering the horrible things that some mortals have done in human history,
  maybe mortality of human beings isn't a bad thing after all,
  at least until they evolve enough;
maybe in the future there would be some way to extend human lifetime;
also there is the possibility of strong artificial intelligence;

regardless, important thoughts can always be recorded, and every generation can study it and improve it;
we may loose our body and personal memories, but our more important thoughts can live for a long time,
  as a collective entity called human knowledge;

root words are made of one or more consonants: (c=ch, x=sh)
, p, b, f, v,    m;
, t, d, s, z, l, n, r;
, c, j, x,    y;
, k, g, h;
to pronounce a word we use vowels in between consonants, such that the word has easy pronunciation;
  a (car), aa (bad), e, ee (seed), o, oo;
vowels are generally not written, except:
, "a" and "e" in the first syllable to indicate verbs or adjectives;
, to teach pronunciation, or when the pronunciation is ambiguous, eg for names of people
  (in which case it's better for the letters to have grayed out color);

subject + verb + adverb + object;
the fact that words are made of consonants with vowels in between,
  makes word boundaries clear, even when speaking fast;
the vowel of the first syllable determines the part of speech:
, "o" or "oo": nouns, prepositions and function words;
, "a" or "aa": verbs;
, "e" or "ee"adjectives and adverbs;
names which are written with initial capital letter, are pronounced with initial "o";
